# msx-engine
An extensive library in Z80 assembly for usage in MSX programs.

It is completely BIOS-free and format-independent. Code made using this library can be ported to any media (disks, carts, tapes, etc) and used under any OS (BASIC, MSX-DOS, etc).

Will eventually be documented in detail and published under the GNU GPL.

I intend to use it to make a Bullet Hell and Roguelike engines.
